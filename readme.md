## Motivation & My Experience

As a digital nomad and vegetarian who has traveled to more than 20 countries in the last two years, I’ve encountered firsthand the challenges of ordering food abroad. For example, while using Uber Eats in China, I found that every menu was in Chinese. Not only was it difficult to translate the item names on the fly, but there was also no efficient way to filter out non-vegetarian dishes. This personal experience inspired me to create Foodiee.ai—a solution that bridges language barriers and dietary restrictions, ensuring that travelers like myself can easily find food that suits their health goals and lifestyle no matter where they are in the world.

## Problem Statement

Travelers often face several challenges when ordering food in unfamiliar locales:

- **Language Barriers:** Menus on food delivery platforms are frequently in local languages, causing confusion and misinterpretation.
- **Dietary Restrictions:** Users with specific diets (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) struggle to quickly identify suitable dishes.
- **Fragmented Reviews:** Feedback on food delivery platforms is isolated, meaning that restaurant reviews aren’t shared across different services.
- **Multiple Platforms:** Discovering and creating accounts on local food delivery services in each new destination can be time-consuming and frustrating.

## Our Solution

Foodiee.ai addresses these challenges by:

- **Providing Real-Time Translation:** Automatically translating menu items and descriptions into the user’s preferred language.
- **Dietary Filtering:** Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and community-driven tagging to identify and filter out dishes that do not meet specific dietary requirements.
- **Aggregating Reviews:** Collecting user feedback across platforms to build a more comprehensive and trusted review ecosystem.
- **Simplifying Access:** Offering a unified experience via a browser plugin (with plans for a mobile app) that aggregates multiple food delivery services, so users can order from one central location.
- **Incentivizing Engagement:** Rewarding users for reviews and feedback, which can later be redeemed for discounts at partner restaurants.

## Features

- **Automatic Menu Translation:** Leverage translation APIs (such as Google Translate or specialized culinary models) to convert menus into the user’s language.
- **Dietary Preference Filtering:** Use keyword identification and NLP techniques to filter out dishes that conflict with user-defined dietary restrictions.
- **Nutritional Insights:** Provide nutritional information and recommendations to help users meet their health goals.
- **User Rewards:** Implement a rewards system to incentivize reviews and feedback.
- **Seamless Integration:** Start with popular platforms like Uber Eats and expand to include local food delivery services worldwide.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Use historical data and user preferences to offer tailored restaurant and dish suggestions.
